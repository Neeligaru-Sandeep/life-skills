# Focus Management  

## 1. What is Deep Work?  
**Definition**:  
Deep Work refers to the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks, producing high-quality work in less time. Coined by Cal Newport, it contrasts with "shallow work" (e.g., emails, meetings).  

### Key Traits:  
- **Uninterrupted concentration** (e.g., 60–90-minute blocks).  
- **High cognitive effort** (e.g., writing, coding, strategic thinking).  
- **Minimal distractions** (no social media, notifications).

## 2. Optimal Duration for Deep Work  
- **Short sessions**: 25–30 minutes (Pomodoro technique).  
- **Standard sessions**: 60–90 minutes (aligned with natural focus cycles).  
- **Limit**: 4 hours/day (beyond this, diminishing returns).

## 3. Are Deadlines Good for Productivity?  
**Pros**:  
- Create urgency and focus.  
- Prevent Parkinson’s Law (work expands to fill time).  

**Cons**:  
- May increase stress, reduce creativity.  
- Encourage rushed, shallow work.  

**Solution**:  
- Set **process deadlines** (e.g., "Draft by Friday") vs. rigid outcomes.

## 4. How to Do Deep Work Properly (Cal Newport’s Rules)  
1. **Schedule Focus Blocks**:  
   - Reserve 2–4 hours daily for deep work.  
   - Use time-blocking (e.g., Google Calendar).  
2. **Eliminate Distractions**:  
   - Turn off notifications.  
   - Use apps like Freedom or Cold Turkey.  
3. **Embrace Boredom**:  
   - Train focus by avoiding multitasking (e.g., no phone during breaks).  
4. **Measure Output**:  
   - Track hours spent in deep work weekly.

## 5. Dangers of Social Media  
1. **Attention Fragmentation**:  
   - Constant switching reduces deep focus capacity.  
2. **Mental Health**:  
   - Linked to anxiety, depression, and FOMO.  
3. **Shallow Relationships**:  
   - Replaces face-to-face connections.  
4. **Addiction**:  
   - Dopamine-driven loops waste time.  

**Fix**:  
- Delete apps or set strict usage limits (e.g., 30 mins/day).

## 6. Diffused Mode Activities  
Give your brain rest with:  
- **Meditation** (5–10 minutes).  
- **Silent Walks** (no podcasts/music).  
- **Shavasana** (lying still, focusing on breath).  
- **Chores Mindfully** (e.g., washing dishes attentively).

## 7. Overcoming Procrastination  
**Method**:  
1. **Work for 30 seconds** on the dreaded task.  
2. **Take a 1-minute break**.  
3. **Repeat**, increasing work time gradually.  

**Why It Works**:  
- Builds "proof" you can start.  
- Reduces fear/boredom by breaking inertia.  

**Example**:  
- **Task**: Writing a report.  
- **Self-talk**: "I’ll just draft one bullet point now."
