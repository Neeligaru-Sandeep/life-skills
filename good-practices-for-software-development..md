# Good Practices for Software Development

## 1. Gathering Requirements

- Make notes while discussing requirements with your team
- Ask questions and seek clarity during the meeting itself (hard to get same people together later)
- Use tools like Trello/Jira if available, otherwise document and share with team for feedback
- When requirements are vague, get frequent feedback during implementation

## 2. Always Over-communicate

**Scenarios requiring communication:**
- Requirements changed (especially if affecting deadlines)
- Technical issues (internet/electricity/hardware problems)
- Implementation taking longer than expected

**Communication best practices:**
- Use group chats/channels over private DMs when possible
- Never miss calls - answer and schedule callback if busy
- Keep video on during meetings to improve rapport

## 3. Stuck? Ask Questions Effectively

**How to ask better questions:**
- Clearly explain the problem
- List solutions you've already tried
- Use visual aids: screenshots, diagrams, screencasts (Loom)
- Share code via GitHub gists or sandboxes (Codepen, Codesandbox)
- Study how issues are reported in open-source projects

## 4. Get to Know Your Teammates

- Make time for your company, product, and team
- Join meetings 5-10 minutes early for informal chat
- Learn teammates' schedules and availability

## 5. Be Mindful of Teammates

- Respect others' time - batch questions into single messages
- Be available when someone responds to you
- Choose communication medium appropriately
- Remember everyone has their own work priorities

## 6. 100% Involvement in Work

**Focus strategies:**
- Treat remote work as real work
- Cultivate deep work practices 
- Separate work and play time clearly
- Silence phones, remove non-work notifications
- Block social media during work hours 
- Track time with apps like Boosted

**Physical wellbeing:**
- Manage food intake (both under/over-eating hurt focus)
- Exercise regularly to maintain energy
