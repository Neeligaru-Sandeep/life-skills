# Learning Process Notes

## 1. Feynman Technique
**Question 1:** What is the Feynman Technique?  
*A method to learn faster by teaching concepts in simple language to identify gaps in understanding.*

## 2. TED Talk by Barbara Oakley: "Learning How to Learn"
**Question 2:** Most interesting story/idea?  
*(Your personal response here - e.g., "The analogy of focused/diffuse thinking modes to a pinball machine was memorable as it visualized how our brain switches between concentrated and relaxed thinking states.")*

**Question 3:** Active vs. Diffused Modes of Thinking  
- **Active Mode:** Focused, concentrated thinking on a specific task (e.g., solving a math problem).  
- **Diffused Mode:** Relaxed, broad thinking that allows creative connections (e.g., insights during a walk).

## 3. Learn Anything in 20 Hours
**Question 4:** Steps to approach a new topic:  
1. Deconstruct the skill into smaller sub-skills.  
2. Learn enough to self-correct.  
3. Remove barriers to practice (tools, distractions).  
4. Practice for at least 20 hours.

## Learning Principles in the Bootcamp

### Key Practices:
- **Deep Work:** Preserve sustained attention; block distractions (e.g., silence phone, use apps like Freedom).  
- **Time Tracking:** Use tools like Boosted to monitor productivity.  
- **Work/Play Balance:** "Work when you work, play when you play."  

### How to Learn Software Concepts:
1. **Application:** Where is this concept used?  
2. **Explanation:** Can you teach it simply?  
3. **Implementation:** Code/design it yourself.  
4. **Deadlines:** Use them as time allocation tools.  

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Conceptual understanding (verbal/written).  
- Clear implementation in code.  
- Proactive communication & time management.

## Action Plan for Improvement
**Question 5:** Actions to improve learning:  
- [ ] Apply the Feynman Technique to explain concepts aloud.  
- [ ] Schedule diffused-mode breaks (e.g., walks) for creativity.  
- [ ] Block distractions during deep work sessions.  
- [ ] Track time to identify productivity patterns.  
- [ ] Teach concepts to peers to solidify understanding.
