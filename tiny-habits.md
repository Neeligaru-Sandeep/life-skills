## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

**Q1: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

**Q2: What is the core message?**  
BJ Fogg uses the formula **B = MAP** to explain behavior:  
- **B** = Behavior  
- **M** = Motivation

- **P** = Prompt (or Trigger)  

To create a new habit, make it easy to do and add a clear prompt instead of depending only on motivation.
